          <h2>The Alienist</h2>
          <p>
            The Alienist opens when a series of haunting, gruesome murders of
            boy prostitutes grips New York City. Newly appointed police
            commissioner Theodore Roosevelt (Geraghty) calls upon criminal
            psychologist (aka alienist) Dr. Laszlo Kreizler (Brühl) and
            newspaper illustrator John Moore (Evans) to conduct the
            investigation in secret. They are joined by Sara Howard (Fanning), a
            headstrong secretary determined to become the city's first female
            police detective. Using the emerging disciplines of psychology and
            early forensic investigation techniques, this band of social
            outsiders set out to find and apprehend one of New York City's first
            serial killers.

                <p>
                  Hannah Dakota Fanning was born on the 23rd of February 1994,
                  in Conyers, Georgia, USA, to Heather Joy (Arrington) and
                  Steven Fanning. Her mother played professional tennis, and her
                  father, now an electronics salesman, played minor league
                  baseball. She is of German, Irish, English, French, and
                  Channel Islander descent. Before her debut into the cinematic
                  world, Dakota did her own acting around her house. She was
                  very active for her age, and often put a blanket under her
                  shirt and pretended to be having a baby, using her younger
                  sister, Elle Fanning, who is also an actress now, as the baby.
