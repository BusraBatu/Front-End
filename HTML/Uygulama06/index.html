    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        According to one of the featurettes on the DVD, Stephen King called this
        film the single most faithful adaptation of his work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Although the voltage used for electric chair executions (2450 volts)
        would not be high enough to cause a current flow through an unsoaked
        sponge properly, it will just act as a resistor and limit the amount of
        current passing through at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Old Paul Edgecomb: We each owe a death - there are no exceptions - but,
        oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are no opening credits after the title has been shown, followed by
        the opening scene for place of film. Although it is now commonplace for
        films to not have opening credits, in 1999 it was somewhat rather
        unusual and it was considered for a trademark of director Frank
        Darabont.
